# KotlinNN
## Description

A Neural Network Library for Kotlin made in Kotlin from Scratch

## Usage

Create instance of class NeuralNetwork: var nn: NeuralNetwork = NeuralNetwork(learningRate, ActivationFunction, layers)

ActivationFunctions supported: TanH, Sigmoid, Relu, Linear

All inputs and outputs are Double Arrays

For training use:
nn.trainSingle(dataset) or
nn.trainBatch(batchSize, dataset)
A dataset can be generated by using the addLabel() function or by writing a class that implements datasetGenerator
