# KotlinNN
## Description

A Neural Network Library made in Kotlin, from scratch.

## Usage

Create instance of class NeuralNetwork: var nn: NeuralNetwork = NeuralNetwork(learningRate, ActivationFunction, layers)  

ActivationFunctions supported: TanH, Sigmoid, Relu, Linear  

All inputs and outputs are Double Arrays  

For training use:  

nn.trainSingle(dataset) or  

nn.trainBatch(batchSize, dataset)  

A dataset can be generated by using the addLabel() function or by writing a class that implements datasetGenerator
